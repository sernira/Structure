<h1>NFT: Nebula Helix / NGC 7293</h1>
<p>"In the heart of the cosmos, where stars meet their end and from their ashes new beauty is born, the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) has taken shape."</p>
<p>One of the brightest and closest planetary nebulae to Earth, located at an approximate distance of 650 light-years in the constellation Aquarius.
 This nebula, due to its appearance resembling a cosmic eye shining in the darkness of space, is known as the 'Eye of God'.
 Its vastness extends over 2.5 light-years — meaning that light, traveling at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second, takes more than two years to cross from one side to the other.</p>
